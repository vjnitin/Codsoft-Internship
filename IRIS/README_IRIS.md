# IRIS Flower Classification

This notebook applies machine learning to the classic IRIS dataset to classify flower species.
It follows five structured steps: Importing Libraries → Data Loading → EDA → Preprocessing → Model Training & Evaluation.
Data is preprocessed using SimpleImputer and StandardScaler, and models are trained and evaluated using cross-validation scores.
Key libraries used include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn (Naive Bayes classifiers).
A great beginner-friendly project demonstrating a complete ML classification pipeline.

# Titanic Survival Prediction

This notebook builds a machine learning model to predict passenger survival from the Titanic dataset.
It follows six steps: Importing Libraries → Data Loading → EDA → Preprocessing → Model Training & Evaluation → Model Comparison.
An extra step of comparing and selecting the best model makes this notebook more comprehensive than a basic pipeline.
Preprocessing includes missing value imputation and feature scaling; models include Naive Bayes variants evaluated via cross-validation.
Key libraries used are NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
